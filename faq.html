				  <h1>FAQ’s ( Frequently asked Questions )</h1>
<hr />
<h3>Reason for Selling</h3>
<p>I simply have no time to devote to these cars. I have always loved Trans Ams and still do.</p>
<p>My weeks go by fast and my weekends go by even faster. I do travel a lot for my business and the time melts away.</p>
<p>I know the new owners will baby these cars and give them the attention deserve.</p>
<p>These cars will shine right back and that is why these cars need is a good home.</p>
<p>These cars need to be driven and loved. That is something that I cannot do.</p>
<p>As you can see, I have sold most of the birdbunker.  I have a great relation with each and every buyer.  They often call or email me and send me pictures of the car.  Every one of the cars I have sold have gone to a great home and that makes me happy.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Are they Numbers Matching ?</h3>
<p>All of these cars <strong>are</strong> numbers matching. Every single one of them. Please feel free to bring your mechanics creeper and check it out for yourself.</p>
<p>None of the past owner information is kept hidden from anyone. For true car collectors and for good quality cars, the more that one can establish the ownership chain, the better it is for the buyer, the seller and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">most importantly the car</span>. No games.</p>
<p>If you buy one of these cars, please be sure and pass all this information along if YOU ever sell the car at some point.   Papers and documents belong WITH car.  The memories are what stay in our heads and hearts.</p>
<p>Over the years, some of the past owners ( before me ) have tracked me down and I have tracked some of them down. Everyone is pleased that the cars are around and well cared for. I cared for and guarded these cars as best I could. Time to let go a bit.</p>
<p>All of these cars are gorgeous. There is not a dog in the bunch.</p>
<p>Looked after and cared for, these cars will continue to appreciate in value. You will appreciate them and the locals in your town will love them. Trans Am’s stand out like a sore thumb everywhere they go. You would certainly never want to use one as a getaway car.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Are these Cars Perfect ?</h3>
<p>No. Of course not. They are 40 – 34 years old so nothing is <em>perfect</em>.</p>
<p>But !! The 81 Grey on Silver car and the 80 White on Blue car are as about as close to a new 34 and 35 old Trans Am as you can get. They are pretty darn close to being “perfect”. They are like new cars.</p>
<p>Read the information for each car separately and I will describe it the best I can. Better yet, you are welcome to come and see the car in person.</p>
<p>The 77 SE Bandit that I had ran and smelled like a new car. There was a patina to the exterior paint which is way way way more than presentable. Just needed to be cleaned. That car is pretty close to perfect as well. I would certainly not paint the car, but who knows what the new owner will do. You would be crazy to paint it......................</p>
<p>All of these cars fire right up and run very very well so there is and was no need to have them running in their videos. We can drive them around the huge parking lot in Cortland. There is not a car here that with the right woman, a fistful of cash and a case of Jim Beam I would not hesitate to drive out to Oregon and back. The age of the tires might be a factor. Mechanically? Not a problem.</p>
<p>These cars have never been out in the rain under current ownership so that means they have missed rain or any moisture for anywhere from 10 – 16 years or so. A long time since they have ever seen a water drop.</p>
<p>The AC cars AC <span style="text-decoration: underline;">probably does not work? </span> ( but maybe they do ? ) as they were never driven that much and the AC was never used. Ditto for the windshield washers etc. Never used. Never needed. Might work. Might not.</p>
<p>The cars all have sheets dating back several years showing the dates that they were taken out, run out of gas and the liters of gas put back into them from a Jerry can at the side of the road and then put back into storage. This happened twice per season. Fresh gas. 2 times per year.</p>
<p>These cars have been stored in pretty well the best conditions for storing cars you can get.</p>
<p>When you buy the car, you get the ownership, keys, and any docs that we got when we bought the car or acquired since. None of these cars are stolen, liened or have dubious pasts.</p>
<p>A US Customs Form 7501 will be provided to you showing that the cars were legally imported by John Shaw ( me ) and the Brokerage at the Peace Bridge in Buffalo, NY was BCB Custom Brokers.</p>
<p>With this, you can register and license your car anywhere in the United States.</p>
<p>Please confirm this FIRST with your local Motor Vehicle license office. There will not be a problem.   Of all the cars I sold, no one had a problem registerring the car in their local state.</p>
<p>Most of the cars have either the PHS information from the USA or the General Motors Canada information for the cars that were imported and sold by General Motors Canada to Canadian GM dealers. Some cars have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">both</span> PHS and GMC.</p>
<p>I think that all the cars were built in Norwood, Ohio. Can’t remember if there is a Van Nuys car in the bunch. You guys can tell from the VIN numbers as you look at the cars.</p>
<p>A lot of the cars were originally sold by Pontiac dealers in the USA. Some were sold by Pontiac dealers in Canada. The cars are the same though except the Canadian cars have KM per hour on the speedometer PLUS the Miles per hour. That is the only difference that I can think of.</p>
<p>Obviously, there is been a lot of interest in the cars and some have sold. The reason for that is that they are very nice cars that are not priced out of sight. I’m not asking stupid money and depending upon the car, that will determine my level of flexibility in the number.</p>
<p>A willing buyer meets a willing seller. Simple.</p>
<p>For the few cars that were painted and restored and you see the level of work that went into these cars, it was for the long haul value. They were done right. No secrets.</p>
<p>I DO NOT have to sell so be careful with the lowball offers and I would strongly discourage it to be honest with you. A fair deal for both parties is the goal.</p>
<p>I do recognize that some people have a geographical advantage over others when wanting to come and look at the cars before others can. What can I say? Make the trip to Cortland if you are really interested.</p>
<p>The cars are posted. The prices are posted.</p>
<p>I will make myself available as much as I can help make these sales go through. My Cell is 519-660-9670.  Feel free to call me at anytime.</p>
<p>No time vampires please. I won’t waste your time. Please don’t waste mine.</p>        </div>
